The django apps are:

* openapi - the bulk of the code, and fast local tests
* userprofile - user specific stuff
* openapi_integration - only contains tests - the ones that need to connect to the IDS Solr server

At time of writing, some functionality is only tested in openapi_integration - we need to increase the test coverage in openapi.
